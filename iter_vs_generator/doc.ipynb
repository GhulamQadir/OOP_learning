    "Iterators and List References\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an iterator from a list using iter(), the iterator\n",
    "does NOT make a new copy of the list. Instead, it keeps a reference\n",
    "to the original list and maintains its own internal position (index)\n",
    "to track where it is during iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "data = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "it1 = iter(data)\n",
    "it2 = iter(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(it1)) # 10\n",
    "print(next(it1)) # 20\n",
    "print(next(it2)) # 10 (separate progress tracking)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iterator has its own \"progress\" (current index), but both refer\n",
    "to the SAME underlying list object.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Updating the Original List\n",
    "\n",
    "If you modify the original list (like appending or changing values),\n",
    "the iterator will reflect those updates because it refers to the same\n",
    "object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "it = iter(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(it)) # 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the original list\n",
    "\n",
    "data.append(4)\n",
    "data[1] = 99\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(it)) # 99 (updated value)\n",
    "print(next(it)) # 3\n",
    "print(next(it)) # 4 (newly added element)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterator didn't store its own copy of the list. It simply walks\n",
    "through the same list object that was updated.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Reassigning the Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "If the list variable is reassigned to a NEW list, the iterator still\n",
    "refers to the OLD list because it keeps the reference to the original\n",
    "object, not the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "it = iter(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "data = [10, 20, 30] # new list assigned\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(it)) # 1 (old list element)\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "'data' now points to a new list in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterator 'it' still points to the old list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both lists exist separately in memory.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Python automatically deletes (garbage collects) objects from memory\n",
    "when there are no more references pointing to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "it = iter(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sys.getrefcount(data)) # 3 references: variable, iterator, and getrefcount itself\n",
    "\n",
    "data = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "print(sys.getrefcount(it)) # iterator still holds old list reference\n",
    "\n",
    "del it # now no reference to old list remains\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all references are gone, Python automatically frees the old list from memory.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying a list → iterator sees updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reassigning a variable → iterator still uses the old list.\n",
    "\n",
    "When no one refers to an object → Python deletes it automatically.\n",
